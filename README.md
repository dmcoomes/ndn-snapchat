# ndn-snapchat

\*\*\* This project has been moved to https://netwisdom.cs.memphis.edu/gitlab/dmcoomes/ndn-photo-app \*\*\*

This is a photo and file sharing application built on Android and is inspired by Snapchat. The project's
goals are to develop a completely decentralized application that runs over the Named Data Network (NDN), utilize
a partial sync protocol, and utilize a Web-Of-Trust like model instead of the traditional NDN hierarchical model.

To run the application, it is recommended that one uses Android Studio. Simply pull this repository and allow the
project to build itself. No other installations are required at this point of time. All dependencies are pulled
from external sources when the build file executes. This application only works on Android OS 6.0 and above.
